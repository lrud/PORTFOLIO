# Portfolio Site

A self-hosted personal portfolio built with Hugo and the hello-friend-ng theme, showcasing selected projects with interactive image displays.

## Features
- Responsive, minimalist design
- Two main sections: About and Projects
- Static top navigation with active page highlighting
- Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn) with icons on the About page
- Custom CSS for layout and styling
- Homepage redirects to About
- Projects page with interactive image carousel and modal enlargement
- Automated local image downloads from GitHub repositories

## Recent Progress
- Added two featured projects: Credit Market Volatility Research and Futures VPOC Backtest
- Automated download of project images from GitHub to local static folders
- Implemented a carousel for multi-image projects (Credit Market Volatility Research)
- Modal image enlargement with click and Escape key support
- For single-image projects (Futures VPOC Backtest), image is displayed outside the carousel with modal support
- Carousel navigation improved: page indicator dots removed, left/right buttons remain
- Visual separation between projects using horizontal rules

## To Do
- Add more projects and automate image integration
- Further refine mobile responsiveness
- Add analytics or contact options
- Polish visual design as needed
