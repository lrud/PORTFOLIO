I'm Lukas, a quantitative analyst completing my M.A. in Economics at Hunter College, focusing on financial econometrics and developing LSTM models for cryptocurrency derivatives markets. I combine academic research with practical experience from product management roles and independent futures trading with proven 13% annual returns.

Currently seeking opportunities in quantitative research, product management, or data analytics where I can apply machine learning to financial markets and product development.
