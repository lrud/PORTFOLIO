title: "Modeling Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Using Machine Learning"
status: "ðŸŸ¦ In Progress"
subtitle: "Masterâ€™s Thesis â€“ Economics"
overview: "This research is being conducted as part of a master's degree in economics. It investigates the unique volatility dynamics of Bitcoin, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models such as LSTM and Jordan Neural Networks. The focus is on modeling implied volatilityâ€”a key input for options pricingâ€”where academic coverage is limited but practical impact is high."
objectives:
  - "Analyze the drivers of Bitcoin implied volatility"
  - "Compare ML models (LSTM, Jordan NN) with traditional financial models"
  - "Assess the role of internal vs. external market factors"
technologies: "Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), Stata (statistical analysis and data preprocessing)"
potential_applications:
  - "Options Pricing: Enhance the accuracy of Bitcoin options valuation using improved implied volatility models."
  - "Risk Management: Support better hedging and risk assessment for institutional and retail participants in crypto derivatives."
  - "Academic Research: Contribute new methodologies and insights to the literature on digital asset volatility modeling."
