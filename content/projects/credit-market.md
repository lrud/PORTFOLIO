objectives:
  - "Model the impact of credit market stress on asset volatility"
  - "Compare volatility dynamics between Bitcoin and NASDAQ"
  - "Visualize and interpret quantile regression results"
technologies: "Stata (panel data prep, regression, quantile regression, table generation), Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib for data visualization)"
